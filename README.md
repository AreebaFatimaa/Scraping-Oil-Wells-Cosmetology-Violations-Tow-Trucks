# Scraping Data for Oil Wells in North Dakota and Cosmetology Violations in Texas
This repo includes scrapers for all the oil wells in North Dakota, all the cosmetology violations associated with someone whose last name is 'Nguyen', and all the tow trucks in 45 zip codes of Houston. You can adapt this code to scrape oil wells in any other state, or cosmetology violations linked with other names, or tow trucks in other zip codes of Houston. Wild out!

# Oil Wells in North Dakota

Here is my code, which I used to scrape information on all the wells in North Dakota. This dataset includes the File number, CTB Number, API Number, Well Type, Well Status, Status Date, Location, Operator, Well Name, and the Field it is situated in from Township numbers 129 to 164. 

And here is the CSV file uploaded to a Google sheet to make your life even easier: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ejBJYX8JsTNiw5IBNhwzEPqigr99IavNsEZ27aau4Gs/edit?usp=sharing

If you decide to do a story based on this data, give me a shout at: (look for contact details in my GitHub profile) 

# Cosmetology Violations by the Nguyens in Texas
I scraped all 80 cosmetology violations for licensees with the last name NGUYEN from the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. But you can do it for someone else, too. Let's get creative! 

# Tow Trucks in 45 Zip Codes of Houston
I scraped information on tow trucks in the following districts of Houston:
    "77002","77021","77040","77059","77078","77098","77384","77479","77547",
